# Lessons — queue

A **queue, not an archive**. Empty is the healthy state. An entry's job is to survive the hours
between the mistake and the next drain — not to be permanent.

Write an entry **at the moment the mistake is caught**, not at the end of the session. By the end
the bug is fixed, the diff looks clean, and the only trace is a correction nobody can reconstruct
into a rule.

**Nothing is carried across two drains.** An entry that survives one drain is an entry nobody
intends to implement, and a queue with permanent residents stops being read. Either implement it,
or decline it in the archive with the reason.

Entries are drained by the `implement-ll` skill and land in `LESSONS-ARCHIVE.md`. Ids (`L<drain>.<n>`)
are assigned at drain time — don't number entries here.

## Entry format

```markdown
### <short title>

- **What happened:** the specific fact, with `path:line` or a quotation. Include *how it was
  caught* — that is frequently the real finding.
- **Generalises to:** one sentence, stated as a rule someone could follow.
- **Candidate home:** a suggestion, explicitly not a decision.
```

`Generalises to` is the filter. If the entry cannot be written as a rule someone could follow, it
is an anecdote and does not belong in the queue.

There is no status field. Presence in this queue is the status.

## What is not a lesson

- A typo.
- A one-off misreading with no general shape.
- A decision that was correctly argued and went the other way.

A queue padded with those is a queue nobody drains.

## Open

### Example — a documented check that was prose, not code

- **What happened:** `CONTRIBUTING.md:44` says "run the linter before pushing", but nothing runs
  it; caught because a lint failure reached CI on a branch whose author had read that line.
- **Generalises to:** A check that exists only as an instruction to a human is not a check; if it
  is mechanically detectable it belongs in a hook or the CI gate.
- **Candidate home:** a pre-commit hook, or the canonical CI task.
